👋 Hi, I’m Demi.

💼 I'm a data analyst based in Denver, currently working in compensation analysis for a federally funded research & development center.

👀 I’m interested in data and predictive analytics related to social trends and influences on business.

🌱 I'm currently developing and improving my skills in data management for business intelligence and various types of data visualization to tell a story.

💞️ I enjoy building relationships and communities to share knowledge in various industries and disciplines.

⚡ Fun fact: I nerd out when it comes to politics, economics, debate, and epistemology.
